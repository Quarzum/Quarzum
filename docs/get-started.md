## Compiled langages

Usually, when you want to create a desktop application, operative systems or other type of complex systems, compiled languages are there for you. Some examples are: C, C++, Rust, Carbon... 

This type of languages offers a **great performance and security**, being great to develop this type of software.

## Why Quarzum borns

But there are some disadvantages with these languages. They have a difficult learning curve, and the security mades more complicated to develop some type of programs. Here is the point **that makes Quarzum unique**.

Quarzum borns like a modern alternative to conventional compiled languages. Our vision of the language is to make it easy to learn, but with the capacity to have that great performance and security that other languages have.

## Status

Currently, **the Quarzum compiler is in-developement**. The language syntax is finished, and soon more documentation will be avaliable to learn more about this project.

## Join us

Quarzum is an **open-source project**, which means that everyone can collaborate to develop the language.
